# GrandCircus-Lab17B-Angular-6-YearOld-Simulator
This is a lab I performed while at Grand Circus Bootcamp. Using Angular we created an app that prints out words to an HTML page using several different Angular features

##Create a page with four buttons:
Words, More Words, Words with Decorations, More word with
Decorations.
- Each button should do the following:
1. add a word at random from a word list you create
2. Words with Decoration - add a word at random from the list of
words with some kind of text decoration (underline, random font
color / size, animation)
3. More Words - add a short phrase from a phrase list you create
More Words with Decorations - 
4. add a phrase at random from the
list of phrases with some kind of randomized text decoration
Some new features to try to incorporate.
ng-class , $interval / $timeout , ng-hide / ng-show ,
